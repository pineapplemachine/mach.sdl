This module wraps SDL_mixer functions that pertain to music playback.
Music can be loaded from a variety of different file formats, provided
a decoder is available, including WAV, MOD, MIDI, OGG, and MP3.

For example, `auto music = Music("mymusic.ogg"); music.play();` would first
load music from an OGG file and then begin playing it.
